# Day 2 (i) – Python Loops

## 📌 Practice Overview
Today’s focus was on understanding and practicing **loops in Python**.
The goal was to get comfortable with repetition, iteration flow, and
basic loop control.

---

## 🧪 Questions Practiced

### Q1. Print numbers from 1 to 10 (for loop)
- Used `for` loop with `range()`

**Concepts involved:**
- `for` loop
- `range(start, end)`

---

### Q2. Print even numbers from 1 to 20
- Iterated through a range
- Used condition to filter even numbers

**Concepts involved:**
- Modulus operator (`%`)
- Conditional logic inside loops

---

### Q3. Print multiplication table of a number
- Took user input
- Generated table from 1 to 10

**Concepts involved:**
- User input
- Loop-based repetition
- Arithmetic operations

---

### Q4. Print numbers from 10 to 1 (while loop)
- Used `while` loop
- Controlled loop using a decrementing counter

**Concepts involved:**
- `while` loop
- Loop condition
- Updating loop variables

---

### Q5. Skip a value while looping
- Printed numbers from 1 to 10
- Skipped a specific number using `continue`

**Concepts involved:**
- `continue` statement
- Loop flow control

---

## 🧠 Key Topics Covered
- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- Loop control statements
- Iteration logic
- Writing clean loop-based programs

---

## 📍 Learning Notes
- Understood when to use `for` vs `while`
- Practiced controlling loop execution
- Focused on readability and correctness

---

## ✅ Status
Completed Day 2 practice successfully.
